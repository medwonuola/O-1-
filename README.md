# O(1)
In this repository, I will be solving a coding problem every day to keep my programming skills sharp and to challenge myself to learn new things.

How to Use This Repository
Each problem solution is located in a separate directory with a self-descriptive name. Inside each directory, you will find:

The problem statement (as a README.md file)
A solution file (usually in Python, and sometimes Dart)
Optionally, additional files such as test files or input/output files
I will be adding a new directory for a new problem every day, so be sure to check back often!

How to Contribute
If you have a coding problem that you think would be a good challenge, feel free to create an issue and I'll take a look! I welcome all contributions.
